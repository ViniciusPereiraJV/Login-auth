## üìñ Approach

This project was developed with the goal of applying and strengthening my programming logic skills, with a focus on secure authentication of real users to help prevent fraud.

During development, I faced significant challenges, especially with Firebase, a technology I had not used before. Additionally, handling error validation for user input required careful attention.

For future steps, I plan to refactor the code to improve its organization and maintainability, as well as implement additional testing to ensure greater robustness and reliability of the system.
